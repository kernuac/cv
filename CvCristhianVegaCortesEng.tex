        \resume{
        I'm a self-taught person who is constantly looking for 
        learning about new technologies and how I can use them for 
        improving proccess or systems and simplify tasks. 
        Also I'm an independent person who can solve problems without 
        a constant supervision.

            Universidad de Atacama - Chile}{
            I'm currently deploying a {\em Datawarehouse}, 
            consolidating internal and external data sources for 
            Universidad de Atacama {\em (Atacama's University)}. Also,
            I'm building visualizations with data from that 
            {\em Datawarehouse}.

            This {\em Datawarehouse} is running on {\em MYSQL}; the 
            data is consolidated using {\em Python} and {\em Pandas} 
            library and visualizations are created using 
            {\em Power-Bi}.

                As a developer at Universidad de Atacama, Chile, I collaborated in the developement
                of an On-line Achademic Requests System for our students, This application was written using 
                {\em PHP} as server side language, {\em MS-SQL Server} for storing data and {\em HTML5 + CSS3 +
                Javascript} for the frontend. With this new software, the time for resolving students 
                request decreased from 15 days to 5 days.

                When the new faculty was created, the first task was to implement networks and
                services. I had to implement a firewall with linux and iptables, 
                a proxy/cache server with squid, two Domain controllers on {\em Windows Server 2008}, 
                a Web server and a captive portal connected with active directory on the Domain
                Controllers. The Proxy Server, Web Server, and some others were virtualized using 
                {\em Xen hypervisor}. This structure allowed to control network traffic and the good use
                of workstations, minimizing issues for viruses and corrective maintenances.

                While I was working for this company, I created some applications for supporting the
                main activities there, for example: a Workflow System, a Purchase Requests System,
                etc. Each application was written as modules for {\em e107-CMS} in {\em PHP}.
                These applications helped to take decisions faster and standardize process.

                On the other Hand, I had to control the network traffic and apply some restrictions for
                accessing to Internet. So, I implemented a little firewall on a {\em Linux} machine
                with {\em iptables}, a Proxy/Cache with {\em Squid}, for filtering content,
                and some monitors like {\em NTOP} for analizing traffic and {\em Calamaris} for 
                analizing Squid's logs. Also, I defined a range of hours when workers can access to
                internet with out restrictions. Finally, the network traffic was optimized after
                that.

                Working for this university, I had to maintain current systems and implementing a 
                Firewall, a Domain controller and a Captive Portal. Current systems was a Proxy
                Cache with {\em SQUID} and, a web server. First, I configured a firewall with iptables on a Linux
                machine. The next task was to implemet a Domain controller on {\em Windows Server 2008}.
                Finally, I worked in a Captive Portal using {\em PFSense} and connected to the Domain
                Controller. This made stronger our infrastructure and minimized issues for viruses
                and corrective maintenances of workstations.

            My final project was a 2D video game prototype written in {\em python} and using 
            {\em pygame} library. This little adventure game tried to help students up to 8 years 
            to practice basic arithmetic calculations such as adittion, substraction, multiplication
            and division.
